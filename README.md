# landing-page
Webpage project

This is the landing page project designed to allow me to practice setting up an actual webpage.

This will involve both HTML and CSS as well as in-depth use of the flexbox display.

Once completed I should have a greater understanding of how webpages function and how to build or edit them in the future.
